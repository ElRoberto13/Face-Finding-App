This program uses a convolutional neural network (using the python library 'facial_recognition') to organize photos. If you give the program a directory of photos to look through and a reference picture, it will find facial matches from the directory and copy the photos into a new directory. This is very useful for finding pictures of yourself in large photo databases.

***How to Run***
Run FindAndSaveFace.py using Python 3.
